## What you will make
In this resource, you will use a BBC micro:bit to control a sprite in Scratch, and fight a colossal intergalactic war.

## What you will learn
By creating a micro:bit game controller with a BBC micro:bit and your Raspberry Pi, you will learn

- How to communicate data between the micro:bit and Scratch
- How to control a Scratch sprite using the micro:bit
- How to make a cool Spaceship game in Scratch
