## What next?

The game has plenty of potential to be improved.

- Can you add in some obstacles for the rocket and UFO to avoid?
- You still have to find a use for the `b` button. Maybe this could start a turbo mode where the rocket flies faster?
- Could the UFO shoot a laser beam at the rocket every now and then?
